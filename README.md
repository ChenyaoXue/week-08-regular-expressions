# Week 08: Regular Expressions

## Overview

This week we will be covering [regular expressions]. A regular
expression is a sequence of characters that form a search
pattern. These search patterns can be used to effectively match string
patterns in text. The idea bloomed in the 1950s with the formalization
of so called *regular languages* by Stephen Kleene. There is great
theoretical interest in regular languages, however, they happen to
also be a practical and powerful programming tool that can be used to
great effect on a daily basis to solve complicated file processing
problems with extreme ease. Knowing how to compose regular
expressions, apply regular expressions, and implement regular
expression engines are one of the true skills the differentiate the
novice from the expert programmer.
